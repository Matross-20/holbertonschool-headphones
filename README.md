![Banner](https://github.com/Devmustroc/holbertonschool-headphones/blob/main/images/Readme/headphone-readme-banner.jpg?raw=true)

Implementing a design from scratch, based on some design models given on [Figma](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/y6_o1T-HtCyTAGuOJqdA_g).

### Concepts

In this project, you will implement from scratch, without any library, a web page. You will use all HTML/CSS/Accessibility/Responsive design knowledges that you learned previously.

You wonâ€™t have a lot of instructions, you are free to implement it the way that you want -
the objective is simple: Have a fully functional web page that looks the same as the designer file.
## Requirements

- you are not allowed to import an external CSS framework (like Bootstrap)
- you are not to use Javascript

**0. Read and be familiar with Figma**

Create an account in Figma and open this project and Duplicate to your Drafts to have access to all design details.

If you can't access to it, please find here the [Figma file](https://www.figma.com/file/gkWRcFqkwtruWZgSfnnHF0/Holberton-School---Headphone-company?node-id=0%3A2)

**1. Header**

Files: [0-index.html](0-index.html/) - [0-styles.css](0-styles.css/)

Building a web page the right way is not easy - expect if you put in place strong foundations:

- reset CSS styling
- use variables
- simple as generic as you can CSS selectors
- avoid as much as you can super specific CSS selector
- simple HTML structure - div containers are your friend!

Last advice: I always start to build a web page from outside to inside and from top to bottom.

Now, your turn!

For this first task: create the header/hero piece

Here is an archive of all assets needed: [images_0x09.zip](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/6AnXuu5fO78UpPRvkBX3cw)


**2. "What we do..." section**

Files: [1-index.html](1-index.html/) - [1-styles.css](1-styles.css/)

Copy files from the previous task.

For this second task: create the What we do... sections

In this section, you will need custom font icons. Here the archive of it: [holberton_school-icon.zip](https://intranet.hbtn.io/rltoken/UTLmru8XUpDXW2EbLdLyew) Inside you will find demo page of how to use it.

Important: try to build as generic as you can, you will probably need some components in the next section.

**3. "Our results" section**

Files: [2-index.html](2-index.html/) - [2-styles.css](2-styles.css/)

Copy files from the previous task.

For this third task: create the results section

Now you can reuse components from the previous task!

**4. Contact us**

Files: [3-index.html](3-index.html/) - [3-styles.css](3-styles.css/)

Copy files from the previous task.

A good landing page has always a contact form.

You are free to add any animations and/or constraints on fields.

**5. Footer**

Files: [4-index.html](4-index.html/) - [4-styles.css](4-styles.css/)

Copy files from the previous task.

Last piece of the page the Footer!
